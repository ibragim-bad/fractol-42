> Desctiption
>
> Fractol is a project of the Graphic Branch of 42. It is
> aimed at exploring fractals, mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale.
> In this project I've practiced in mathematics with complex numbers. My implemetation 
> can display 4 different fractal sets, such as Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Duck set and one random set.
